## Task1
The PhoneNumberValidator class is a simple utility that reads a text file **(files/file.txt)** containing a list of phone numbers, where each line represents one phone number.
The project's primary goal is to identify and display valid phone numbers following two specific formats: "**(xxx) xxx-xxxx**" or "**xxx-xxx-xxxx**."

**Example Input (files/file.txt):**
```
987-123-4567
123 456 7890
(123) 456-7890
```
**Example Output (console):**
```
987-123-4567
(123) 456-7890
```

## Task2
The JsonBuilder —Ålass is a simple utility that reads a text file **(files2/file.txt)**, transforms its content into a list of User objects, and then writes these objects to a new JSON file **(files2/user.json)**. 
This project is designed to help users convert structured text data into a JSON format for easier data interchange and processing.

**Example Input (files2/file.txt):**
```
name age
alice 21
ryan 30
```

**Example Output (files2/user.json):**
```
[
    {
        "name": "alice",
        "age":21

    {
        "name": "ryan",
        "age":30
    }
]
```
